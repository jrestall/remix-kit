### Setup

```shell
> cd ./your-remix-app
> npx remix-kit@latest install

> npm run vite:dev
```

Please see the [getting started](./docs/getting_started.md) guide for details.

### Features

- [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement) for **instant, precise updates** on the browser and server without reloading the page or blowing away application state.
- Instant development server startup, **no pre-bundling required**, scales to any project size.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and build bundling. Includes [vite-node](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/packages/vite-node) for extremely fast targeted server code replacement. No purgeRequireCache needed, keep objects in-memory between requests to match production behavior.
- Fully **configurable** & easily **extensible**
  - An extensible compiler and hooks system gives you complete control.
  - Use [hooks](packages/remix-schema/src/types/hooks.ts) from your own `plugin modules` to extend any part of the build process.
  - Benefit from the large ecosystem of vite plugins.
- Easy to use CLI `remix-kit` for development, build, previews and more.
- **Seamless integration** of Tailwind CSS with PostCSS. No need for multiple CLIs.
- View **library agnostic**, with existing plugin for [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- Monorepo support, place your routes in libraries outside the main app to better separate your functionality amongst teams.
- Integrated dotenv, bundle analysis, hierarchy based `remix.config.js`, file ignore with `.remixignore` and much more!

### Status

- **Alpha.** Use to streamline your development but not recommended for production bundling use. Please help test and it can get there though.
- **NodeJS server support only**. No Cloudflare workers.
